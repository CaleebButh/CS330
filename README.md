How do I approach designing software?

for me, breaking down the problem into small chunks
and tackling them one by one is getting easier. the hard part for me
is learning how it all fits together. for this project i used a whiteboard
to map out what files talk and interact with each other. this helped 
so much with the whole process. 

How do I approach developing programs?

I try my best to develope my programs incrementally,
following my plan as far as i can until I reach a point where my 
program can output something new, testing as I go. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science can help me accomplish my goals by 
bringing me a career change which I've never been more ready
for.
